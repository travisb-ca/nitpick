The design of the nitpick repository is meant to keep the amount of manual
merging to a minimum. Some merging will undoubtedly be necessary.

To effect this every file is named after the sha256 hash of the contents and
is referenced as such. Within the top level .nitpick directory of the project
there is the following structure:

.nitpick/
        /config/
               /config - configuration file for the repository
	       /users  - list of users for this repository
	/a - indirect issue directory
	/b
	/c
	...
	/f
	/0
	/1
	...
	/9/a
	/9/b
	...
	/9/9/99abc...f879/issue - Root issue description
	/9/9/99abc...f879/ab897..abc - comment 1
	/9/9/99abc...f879/feb87..876 - comment 2

Not all indirect issue directories will exist as they are created as needed.

The file formats follow a simple, easily hand edited format of some metadata
followed by two dashes, followed by the free form data. ie.
